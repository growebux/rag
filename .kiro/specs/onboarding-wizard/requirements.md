# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Onboarding Wizard is an intelligent documentation-based guidance system designed to help guide applicants navigate the ToursByLocals onboarding process. The system will be trained on onboarding documentation and provide contextual help through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), with AI chat support for additional assistance. Initially, the system will focus on providing guidance rather than tracking actual step completion, serving as a proof of concept that can be expanded upon.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a guide applicant, I want to access a wizard-style interface that shows me the onboarding steps and provides guidance, so that I understand what needs to be completed and how to do it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guide applicant accesses the onboarding system THEN the system SHALL display a wizard interface showing all onboarding steps
2. WHEN a guide views the wizard THEN the system SHALL display the onboarding sections in logical order
3. WHEN a guide selects a step THEN the system SHALL show detailed guidance for that section
4. WHEN a guide navigates between steps THEN the system SHALL maintain the interface state
5. WHEN the wizard loads THEN the system SHALL present a clean, intuitive interface based on the provided inspiration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a guide applicant, I want to receive contextual help and guidance based on onboarding documentation, so that I understand what information is required and how to complete each section properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guide views any onboarding step THEN the system SHALL provide relevant help content using RAG trained on documentation
2. WHEN a guide requests help for a specific section THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display contextual information from the documentation
3. WHEN the RAG system processes queries THEN the system SHALL use the onboarding documentation as the knowledge base
4. WHEN help content is displayed THEN the system SHALL present information in a clear, actionable format
5. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL allow for retraining the RAG system with new content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a guide applicant, I want to access a chat interface when I need additional support, so that I can get personalized help when the standard guidance isn't sufficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guide needs additional help THEN the system SHALL provide access to an AI-powered chat interface
2. WHEN a guide asks questions in chat THEN the system SHALL use OpenAI integration to provide intelligent responses
3. WHEN the chat system responds THEN the system SHALL incorporate relevant onboarding context and documentation
4. WHEN a guide uses chat support THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history within the session
5. WHEN chat interactions occur THEN the system SHALL log conversations for system improvement

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure which OpenAI model is used for the chat and RAG functionality, so that I can optimize performance and costs based on our needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses system configuration THEN the system SHALL allow selection of available OpenAI models
2. WHEN a model is selected THEN the system SHALL apply the configuration to both RAG and chat functionality
3. WHEN model configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate the model is accessible and functional
4. IF a configured model becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to a default working model
5. WHEN model usage occurs THEN the system SHALL track usage metrics for cost monitoring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a guide applicant, I want to see the onboarding sections and understand what each involves, so that I can navigate through the process systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guide accesses the onboarding system THEN the system SHALL display all onboarding sections clearly
2. WHEN a guide views sections THEN the system SHALL show the logical flow and dependencies between sections
3. WHEN a guide selects a section THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive guidance for that area
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL present sections in an organized, easy-to-follow manner
5. WHEN sections are displayed THEN the system SHALL indicate what each section involves and its importance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to maintain code quality standards, so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL pass TypeScript type checking without errors
2. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL pass linting rules without warnings
3. WHEN code is formatted THEN the system SHALL follow consistent formatting standards
4. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL maintain high test coverage for critical functionality
5. WHEN code is deployed THEN the system SHALL have no technical debt violations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a guide applicant, I want to understand the specific onboarding sections (Profile, Personal Information, Payment, Tours, Calendar, Quiz) and their requirements, so that I know what to expect and how to prepare.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guide views the onboarding sections THEN the system SHALL display Profile, Personal Information, Payment, Tours, Calendar, and Quiz sections
2. WHEN a guide selects the Profile section THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on profile picture, bio, expertise areas, and languages
3. WHEN a guide selects Personal Information THEN the system SHALL explain required personal details and payment setup
4. WHEN a guide selects Tours section THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on creating and publishing required tours
5. WHEN a guide selects any section THEN the system SHALL use RAG to provide detailed, contextual help based on documentation
